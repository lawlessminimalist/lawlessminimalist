### 🚀 About Me

🎓 I am completing a BSc at **Queensland University of Technology** 🏫 where i'm studying a Major in **Computer Science** and Minors in **AI** / **Mobile Application Dev**. I've got some professional experience in ☁️ Cloud Computing, in particular with AWS serverless deployments/fundamentals. 

🔭 I'm on the lookout for open-source projects to collaborate on and small self-started projects to further refine my software engineering skills. I'm currently focused on improving my multi-threading and concurrent programming skills.

🌱 I’m currently learning **JS** and **React** through passion projects, and **OOP** **Java** and **.Net** for work and backend purposes. I find myself drawn to **ML** and data analysis through **Python** as well, so my next project will likey incorporate these stacks.
