### 🚀 About Me

🎓 I am completing a BSc at Queensland University of Technology 🏫 where i'm studying a Major in Computer Science and Minors in AI / Mobile Application Dev.

🔭 I’m currently working on a price selection toolkit that will enable users to sell their second-hand goods at an established market rate. This is a hobby project i've undertaken for both the purpose of learning full-stack JS and also creating a tool that I would use myself.

🌱 I’m currently learning JS and React through passion projects, and OOP Java and .Net for work and backend purposes. I find myself drawn to ML and data analysis through python as well, so my next project will likey incorporate these stacks.
